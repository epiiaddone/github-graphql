## Overview

Search for a GitHub repo and star that repo. 

Two implementations: React Query and Apollo Client.

- Unlike React Query, Apollo Client interacts directly with the GraphQL API and therefore, doesnâ€™t require a separate function that uses fetch.

- From GitHub "The GitHub GraphQL API offers more precise and flexible queries than the GitHub REST API"

## Technologies

- React: 18.2.0
- ReactQuery: 4.32.0
- TypeScript: 4.9.5
- GraphQL: 16.7.1
